# Challenge 1

## Project setup

This project represents a project that was submitted by a user and contains a problem they ran into. To get the project into the right state for tackling the problem, do the following:

#### 1. Set up a PostgreSQL database and import data

You find the data to import in [`./db/mydb.sql`](./db/mydb.sql). If you're unsure about how to import it into your database, you can learn more about this [here](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/blob/master/docs/import-and-export-data/postresql.md).

#### 2. Specify database credentials in Prisma schema

Go into [`./prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma) and replace the uppercase placeholders in the `url` of the `datasource` with the connection details of your database.

#### 3. Install project dependencies

Run the following command in this directory:

```
npm install
```

#### 4. Run Prisma's development mode

Start Prisma's development mode with the following command:

```
prisma2 dev
```

This should now throw the error that's further described below. 

## Problem description

Help! My application broke after I upgraded it to the `preview016` release. I didn't touch anything in my project, just upgraded and now I can't run `prisma2 dev` any more, it always gives me this error:

```
$ npx prisma2 dev
Error in migration engine: [2019-11-25T10:23:33Z INFO  quaint::pool] Starting a PostgreSQL pool with 9 connections.
thread 'tokio-runtime-worker-0' panicked at 'Error parsing the migration steps: Error("unknown field `name`, expected `model`", line: 1, column: 59)', src/libcore/result.rs:1165:5

How can I fix this problem?
